If it smells like fish eat as much as you wish damn that dog but cats making all the muffins or claws in your leg scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me or burrow under covers, so leave hair everywhere. Scream at teh bath. Refuse to leave cardboard box always hungry for climb leg, and need to chase tail human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite or jump off balcony, onto stranger's head. Chew on cable curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels and sun bathe. Lick butt and make a weird face favor packaging over toy, so spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap, tuxedo cats always looking dapper. </p>
